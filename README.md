# React YouTube

Create a React application that lets you search for YouTube videos using the YouTube API, then choose a video from a list to watch.

This project is designed to assess the React skills you have gained so far.
There are 7 features that need to be written. Each completed function (passes all the tests) will be worth 1 point.
A minium of 5 points must be attained in order to pass this assessment.
You may receive partial credit (0.5 points) for features that are close but do not work exactly as specified.

## Project overview

For this project, you will work with at least one other person to recreate parts of the YouTube application.

## Getting started

After having been assigned a group, complete the following:

-   [ ] Read the rest of this document in full.
-   [ ] Create a new [Trello board](https://trello.com/) with your group, making it public. Include three columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done". Make sure everyone has access to the board.
-   [ ] Have each member of the group read the guide on [working in groups](./docs/working-in-groups.md). Afterwards, discuss what you read about as a group.
-   [ ] Read the project requirements in the [requirements](./docs/requirements.md) document. For each feature, build a new card in the Trello.
-   [ ] Once you have built the cards you believe you need, prioritize the cards so that the most important are towards the top.
-   [ ] Have one person create a repository on GitHub. Invite your group members to be able to work on the repository.
-   [ ] Have one person create a react application with `create-react-app`. Update the `readme.md` file to include a link to your Trello board as well as the names of everyone in your group. Then, push up the code to the GitHub repository.
-   [ ] Submit your repository's URL _now_ even though you will only have two commits.

One goal of this project is to practice working on projects together. Therefore, it is OK if the process above takes some time. It's part of what is required to complete this project!
